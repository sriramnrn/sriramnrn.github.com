      <title>Making Continuous Delivery happen - ThoughtWorks Talks Tech March 2019</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I presented on &amp;ldquo;Making CD happen&amp;rdquo; at the ThoughtWorks Talks Tech March 2019 edition at the ThoughtWorks Singapore office&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;embed slideshare&#34;&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/IAdleXumavC1DV&#34; width=&#34;599&#34; height=&#34;487&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; style=&#34;border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use slides to support my message, so there is sometimes context around the various slides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, organisations have been increasingly recognising that along with governance and project management (read, scrum), they need to pay attention to engineering practices too. The result has been an increasting move to achieve  &lt;a href=&#34;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html&#34;&gt;Continuous Delivery&lt;/a&gt; (or &amp;ldquo;CI/CD&amp;rdquo; as it is unfortunately often also known).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that the IT budget went into expensive scrum and &amp;ldquo;CI/CD&amp;rdquo; tool implementations, dedicated staff, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a plethora of tools and consultants, lots of tutorials and IT budgets assigned to such initiatives, there are a lot of implementations out there which are not yet delivering results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are still defects in production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a lot of wait-time between code-commit to go-live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triaging defects continues to take time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration between workstreams continues to be risky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixing a defect doesn’t guarantee that nothing else got broken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes pushed to prod often leads to failures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What works in one environment doesn’t work in others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Some standup anti-patterns</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;See my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sriramnarayanan.com/talk-on-standups/&#34;&gt;slide deck&lt;/a&gt; that I usually use when giving a talk on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the many practices that people start to follow when they decide to &amp;ldquo;go agile&amp;rdquo;, is the daily standup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason Yip&amp;rsquo;s article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html&#34;&gt;standups&lt;/a&gt; is often considered the reference article (that&amp;rsquo;s me in the red t-shirt in that pic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years, various organisations and teams have adopted the practice of a standup along with many other practices in the hopes of being Agile. As an outside observer, I often get to spot various anti-patterns in standup practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some standup anti-patterns to identify and address:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
